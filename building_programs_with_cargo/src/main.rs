        Cargo is the package manager of the Rust

        Cargo is very handful for Rust developer since Cargo handles a lot tasks for them, such as,downloading the libraries your code depends on,building these libraries


        cargo new <directory_name>
            Builds a new project
        Cargo automatically creates files that you need

        Cargo.toml is in the TOML(Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) format, which is configuration format for Rust. This is used to handle dependencies(libraries)

        cargo run
        Compiles your project and runs it in one step

        You can check Cargo book for further informations
