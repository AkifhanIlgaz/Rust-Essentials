fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    /*
        You might know what is happening here.

        Bind the value 5 to x

        Copy the value of x and bind it to y

        This is called copying in Rust.

        Fixed-size variable can be easily copied and pushed onto the stack. This would be different if our variable types are not fixed-size.
